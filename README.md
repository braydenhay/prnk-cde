Hello to anyone looking at this. My name is Brayden, and this is a little bit of code in C# that was blatantly stolen by Barnacules with some variation thrown in by me.
It was coded using Visual Studio, and I recommend using it to open this project, should you feel the need to.
As of right now, there is no executable for this file, but I will be making one soon, don't worry ;).

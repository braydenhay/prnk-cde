Hello to anyone looking at this. My name is Brayden, and this is a little bit of code in C# that was blatantly stolen by Barnacules with some variation thrown in by me.


It was coded using Visual Studio, and I recommend using it to open this project, should you feel the need to.


It requires the .NET Framework, so if you don't think that you have it, go [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130 "The Microsoft Download Page for .NET").


~~No executable right now. It'll be there soon. Don't worry ;D~~ The executable is located in the bin folder.
